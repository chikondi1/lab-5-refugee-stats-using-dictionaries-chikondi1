# Lab 5 â€“ Refugee Stats using Dictionaries - Chikondi

This code creates a dictionary of refugee data from 5 different countries. The data has been collected from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp and the countries chosen are Kenya, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Sudan. The inputs are country names and number of refguees and the outputs are a dictionary that includes keys and values that allow the code to display the number of refugees in each country. 

The major error I encountered was when I tried to webscrape the source page so that it would add the number. I used this website to help me https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/10857/how-to-scrape-a-table-from-a-webpage but unforutnatley I could not figure out what to do. I ended up transferring the data to an Excel document and using the SUM function to add the numbers up, but would like to learn how to do it through webscraping.

Code is located in lab5 of the repo.
